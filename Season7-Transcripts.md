# St Hospitals 

Mark: (Chipsticks or Frazzles? Chipsticks or Frazzles? Chipsticks or Frazzles?)

Jeremy: Shall I go on?

Mark: God, it's like a Stasi torture block.

Jeremy: The fetal head then passes below the pubic arch. At this point, the woman may feel a burning or stinging sensation.

Mark: The phrase, no shit Sherlock comes to mind.

Jeremy: How much more do you want? What's an episiotomy?

Mark: You don't want to know mate.

Jeremy: Why?

Mark: Well, you know, between your bum and your genitals, that area?

Jeremy: It's one of my favorite areas.

Mark: Yeah, well, imagine someone snipping it with scissors.

Jeremy: Oh my fucking life.

Mark: Yeah, either that or you can have it pull apart like wet tissue paper. Sophie's mum. Hello?

Jeremy: (So glad I'm not a woman. Worst thing that can happen to me is getting sent to war. Even then, I can find a cave and eat blackberries and tug myself off till it's over.)

Mark: She's in Northumberland. They're on their way, but it could be five or six hours. Shit, I can't be the birth partner.

Jeremy: (Hold on, I see where this is going. I ain't no birth partner.) Dude, you are gonna be a great birth partner.

Mark: The truth is, and I really wish it wasn't true, but I'm a pedophobe, to be honest.

Jeremy: Oh, right. (Oh my life.) I mean, I suppose I always wondered whether--

Mark: I've always felt really weird around children, you know?

Jeremy: Right, yeah. (Act supportive or punch his lights out?) And are you gonna get help for--

Mark: I don't know, I mean what sort of help can you get for an irrational fear of children?

Jeremy: Pedophobe, oh right.

Mark: What did you think I meant? Oh, my God, Jeremy!

Jeremy: It's just pedo, phobe. I mean, they're both bad. I thought you were saying you were a mega-pedo.

Mark: You thought I was saying I was a mega-pedo? And your reaction was that you'd always wondered?

Jeremy: I was grappling, I was grasping.

Yana: Mark Corrigan?

Mark: I'm just going back in, I was only looking at the crisps and I got distracted. I've been three minutes max, honestly.

Yana: You are allowed out.

Mark: (You're nice, I wish I was having a baby with you.)

Yana: We'll be in to see Sophie shortly and if things haven't progressed, we can always give her a cervical sweep, okay?

Mark: The cervical sweep.

Jeremy: Chim chim cher-ee.

Mark: So listen, I've spoken to your mum and she's on her way.

Sophie: Oh, thank God.

Mark: But hold your horses just one sec, because they are actually on their way from Northumberland, so until she gets here, I am very much your man.

Sophie: Fucking hell.

Mark: Oh... (What do I say? Can't sit back and watch, eating popcorn. Can't alleviate.) Ow, poor Soph, does it hurt?

Sophie: Yes, it fucking hurts!

Mark: Might be your mum. Hello? Oh, what, the boiler, you're kidding! But, it's just, no, sorry, thank you. I'll get it sorted. Wasn't your mum, it was just, a tiny thing, my boiler, it's nothing. It's cool, it's nothing, minor explosion. Forget it, I'm focused, okay, baby. Apparently, there's water leaking downstairs, so irrelevant.

Sophie: Can you fetch the TENS machine, Mark, it's really starting to.

Mark: Right, okay, the TENS machine. (While my flat fills with water, what you need is an almost imperceptibly low dose of battery-powered pain relief.)

Sophie: Can you try and relax, Mark?

Mark: Sure, understood, I won't get anxious.

Sophie: Oh, it's rubbish.

Mark: (Placid lake of water, placid lake of water filling up my flat from the gushing broken boiler.)

Sophie: Has the nurse said anything about the pool yet?

Mark: Oh, what, water birth, isn't that a bit, zany?

Sophie: I really feel I'll be much happier in the pool!

Mark: Okay then, I'm on it, Soph, I'm on it for you.

Sophie: And remember to ask for one of those nets for poo and bits, Mark.

Mark: Will do.

Jeremy: (God, how did he get so old? I'll never let myself get so old. I mean, you have to get old up to a point, but that's ridiculous. Still nothing from Elena. I'll never fool anyone as beautiful as Elena into loving me again. Maybe I should kill myself. Gary Neville's conservatory is nice. Hello, put that suicide bid on hold. Okay, a book, egghead alert.) So, The Famished Road, is that a sequel?

Zahra: I'm sorry?

Jeremy: To the one that was a film about the end of the world, The Road? 'Cause they were hungry enough in that.

Zahra: Good one.

Jeremy: Didn't even know it was a one.

Zahra: I'm Zara.

Jeremy: Jeremy. So, what are you in for? You don't have to tell me if it's disgusting.

Zahra: My boyfriend's in intensive care.

Jeremy: (Boyfriend.) Oh.

Zahra: Yeah, he's in a bad way, unconscious. They don't know when he's going to come round.

Jeremy: That's terrible. (Terri-brill.)

Mark: (Okay, birthing pool, don't believe in it but I have to sell it. I'm Clare Short, backing Iraq, Trinny and Susannah endorsing Nescafe.) Hi, hello, I wondered what happened to the nurse from before?

Nurse: Which nurse?

Mark: The one who was, (nice), here.

Nurse: Yana's finished her shift.

Mark: Ah, oh, okay. Well, we discussed the possibility, earlier of using a pool.

Nurse: Well, I don't have a note of that.

Mark: (Great, Yana's a flake. The lovely nurse who doesn't write anything down. She probably only works here to get her hands on ludes.)

Nurse: And both birthing pools are all either occupied or--

Mark: Look, I need a pool, okay? We want a natural birth. God knows some people aren't convinced of the benefits of a water birth, but I for one am not one of them. So, please could you sort that out?

Nurse: I'll see what I can do. Very well. Good day. (Good day? God, I'm so stern. Maybe I'll end up marrying her instead and we'll have brisk, clinical sex.)

Jeremy: How's it going, dude?

Mark: I estimate we're looking at a five centimeter cervix, plus the boiler's exploded.

Jeremy: (Hey, that's Zara's.)

Mark: Who was that good plumber, Sophie's nice guy?

Jeremy: Look, you're stressing it. How about I sort it?

Mark: Really?

Jeremy: Really?

Mark: Thanks, man.

Jeremy: (He's so lucky I'm the kind of guy who would never spike a coffee with Rohypnol. Too many practical risks before we even get into the moral considerations.)

Mark: Okay, pretty tough but I managed it. I said, listen, you do things our way. My birth partner has requested this and I don't care if I have to take it to the very top of the GMC, got it?

Sophie: Mark, I can't do this.

Mark: Okay. Is that better, or is that better?

Sophie: I don't care!

Mark: Or is that better?

Sophie: Oh, I want it to stop, it's all too much.

Mark: Soph, it's okay, we'll get you in the pool, I'm gonna sort it.

Sophie: I don't want a pool, I need pain relief, Mark!

Mark: Oh, you don't want the pool?

Sophie: No, I want an epidural or someone to smack me on the head or, fuck!

Mark: It's just I did ask very firmly for the pool. If I go back now, I'll look--

Sophie: You'll look what?

Mark: It's just, it'll weaken my negotiating position. No, Soph, yep, I'm on it, just a tiny query. Can you remember, not at your last place, but the place before, the name of that nice plumber? Was it Tom or Tim? No biggy, but if it jumps into your head, can you just pop the number down there, would you?

Jeremy: (Wow, private room, this guy's lucked out.)

Zahra: Hi, Ben, I'm back.

Jeremy: Hi, Ben.

Zahra: I thought this might inspire him, you know, to write a novel, now he's unconscious.

Jeremy: Mm-hm, right. You know, it's funny, just looking at him, I could tell we'd get on. He looks like a laugh, a right laugh. I sort of want to shake his hand. Would that be all right?

Zahra: Oh, go ahead.

Jeremy: Ben, sleepy Ben. (I want to steal your girlfriend, Ben I think I love your girlfriend.)

Zahra: Sleepy Ben, that's nice.

Jeremy: (I definitely don't hope he dies. Definitely not, that would be horrible, but he does look like he could do with a nice long relaxing coma.)

Nurse: Oh, it's you again.

Mark: Yes.

Nurse: Okay, well after a lot of hassle, I've actually managed to swap things around, and it looks like the birthing pool will be available, so--

Mark: Yes, well as it happens, things have changed and my partner no longer requires the pool. No, we want the what's it called, the drugs pipe, the heroin pump, the crack tube, whatever you've got. I want to stop her suffering.

Nurse: Wish I'd known this earlier.

Mark: (You might be ripe for a trim, in the cuts.)

Jeremy: So, before the accident, how long had you two been, hanging out?

Zahra: Three months.

Jeremy: Okay. And how was it going, were you two very?

Zahra: Oh, he's very committed to his work and he did the Iron Man triathlon, twice.

Jeremy: Wow, so out of those three months, you can knock off at least two weeks for training.

Zahra: He loves his dance music, and drugs and video games.

Jeremy: God, really?

Zahra: Where as I love to read.

Jeremy: Oh, me too. I adore to read, it's amazing, isn't it? Because a book, I always say, can be about anything.

Zahra: That's so true. Yeah, I often read to Ben, but he's more of a magazine. FHM, kind of guy.

Jeremy: Right, yeah.

Zahra: Oh, shit, I'd better get this. Would you like to?

Jeremy: Oh, sure. This month's hot tip.

Zahra: Hello?

Jeremy: The premier Wrangler collection. When has good denim ever been cheap? The answer is never. Look, dude, bit of a weird one, but if you aren't gonna make it through, I mean if you can't, then don't worry, because Zara's great. And, I'll be waiting, and if you check out, in a friendly way, not like a vulture, to check in. And don't worry, I'm not gonna start waggling on any of your tubes, but, and if you have a problem with anything I've just said then, do give me a sign. No, okay. I'm in a swimming pool and my bikini pops off. I'm not bothered, I'll just carry on, and that's a comment from Kayleigh Islip. You see a picture of Kayleigh there, and her nice bum.

Mark: Jez?

Jeremy: Oh, hi, Mark.

Mark: What are you doing?

Jeremy: I'm reading FHM to this unconscious guy.

Mark: But why?

Jeremy: Because I have a heart.

Mark: Yeah?

Zahra: Work's crazy, thanks so much.

Mark: Oh, okay.

Jeremy: What?

Mark: Nothing.

Jeremy: What?

Mark: Nothing.

Jeremy: No, go on, what?

Mark: No, it's fine.

Jeremy: What are you saying?

Mark: Nothing.

Jeremy: Look, there's no need to be all cynical, just because--

Mark: Jeremy, it's fine. I'm actually quite glad it's all a filthy duplicitous ploy. I was worried you had a personality change.

Jeremy: Oh, just because I'm doing something decent, there has to be some weird thing going on?

Mark: Yes, normally, yes.

Zahra: Thanks, Jez.

Mark: I should be getting back to Sophie. Jez, would you consider coming with me? I don't think I'm coping all that well.

Jeremy: Yeah, cool man.

Mark: You don't mind?

Jeremy: No, kind of always wanted to see a birth. Be kind of like Alien but sexy, sexy Alien.

Mark: Hey, Soph, it's me, and Jez!

Sophie: When's the anesthetist coming, Mark, I need something?

Mark: Okay, look, I went crazy at them, I totally lost it actually, but the thing is that the anesthetist has this C-section now, and then there's another procedure that he's booked into--

Sophie: What?

Jeremy: Tell them to pull their fingers out, Mark.

Mark: Look, the anesthetist can't be in two places at once. I mean, I wish he could, but he can't. (How did I become the hospital spin doctor?)

Sophie: I want an epidural!

Midwife: Hello, hello, Sophie, how we doing? Hi, boys. Okay, darling, baby's doing fine. I just wanna see how you're doing, see how dilated you are, okay?

Mark: (Stuck on the medical channel and there's no remote control.)

Jeremy: Maybe some music?

Mark: Yes, yeah, maybe some music.

Sophie: Uh-huh.

Mark: (What a bastard. That's gonna drive us all totally bonkers.)

Midwife: Yeah, you're doing great, you're fully dilated. Your baby's coming, there's no time for an epidural.

Sophie: She put her whole hand in.

Mark: Blimey.

Sophie: I didn't think she'd put her whole hand in.

Mark: No, God.

Jeremy: Look, maybe I should go.

Mark: (Of course, brings the insufferable music, then goes. He's like the 1980s.) Hello, Hans? Oh, okay, I'll be right down. That was Super Hans. He's here, he wants money to fix the boiler.

Jeremy: Yeah, I called him earlier, boiler's sorted.

Mark: You called Super Hans about the boiler? Super Hans is our plumber?

Jeremy: No, not Hans, his mate, his mate's a plumber.

Mark: Oh, great, I wonder if he appears on the CORGI Gas Safe Register, or just the sex offenders? (That's right, pay Hans to do the plumbing, swap the cow for some magic beans.) Half a monkey, as requested. (Why am I dealing in animals? No animal-based transaction has ever gone well.)

Super Hans: It's for parts and that.

Mark: (I'll probably end up with half a Ford Escort and some porno tapes and we'll call it all square.) Is he the plumber?

Super Hans: Relax, Mark, we can definitely do plumbing, it's not an issue. Trojan's very capable, after his sleep. Plumbing's just fucking Lego, innit, water Lego. So, how's it all going with Soph and the baby?

Mark: You know, for a while it's been pretty boring but I think we're getting to the utterly terrifying bit.

Super Hans: Take my advice, stay away from the goal end, mate.

Mark: Yeah?

Super Hans: Yeah. You don't wanna get thinking about that. It's like the Channel Tunnel. Lovely, it's all about your holidays, but imagine you saw a fucking huge baby come out of it. Never be the same again.

Mark: Right.

Super Hans: One other tip, trip.

Mark: What?

Super Hans: Trip your fucking nuts off, makes it amazing.

Mark: Isn't it pretty amazing anyway?

Super Hans: Dunno, yeah, maybe, but if you're tripping and you're having a baby, it's like, fuck! You know, you see a little guy come out of there, what's gonna happen next? Frogs out of her arsehole, milk out of her ears, anything's possible. Oi.

Trojan: What?

Super Hans: Let's drive.

Mark: (If those two fix my boiler, I think it will be more surprising than if Sophie gave birth to a working replica of Stephenson's Rocket.) Hi, Soph, back now, can I do anything?

Midwife: You're doing great, Sophie. You're doing good.

Mark: (Oh, God, the screaming, poor Sophie. I definitely couldn't give birth. I want to call Dignitas when I get lumber pain.)

Midwife: Now, don't push if you don't need to. Take a rest, Sophie. You're doing well.

Mark: (I can't just keep standing to attention like Captain Mark Phillips. Could march around the room like Nelson on his quarterdeck. I'm just a spare part.)

Midwife: Why don't you stop walking round like that and come over here?

Mark: (And the fun part is, everything I do is basically wrong. If I can just get hold of a hand, that might feel useful.)

Sophie: Oh, it's now, Mark, it's now!

Mark: Right, right, yes, I'm sure, but just don't use all your energy, 'cause you did say that eight hours ago, and it wasn't now, and I don't want to be a doubting Thomas, but--

Sophie: Bastard, bastard, fat bastard!

Mark: (Is that for me or just general bastarding?)

Sophie: Oh, fuck off, fuck off!

Mark: (If she keeps saying fuck off, I might fuck off. That's gotta be within your rights, to fuck off, if someone repeatedly screams at you to fuck off.) Can I, I just need to nip to the little boys' room. (Yeah, the little boys' room, for little boys.)

Jeremy: There we go, one for you and one for Ben.

Zahra: Thanks, Jez.

Jeremy: I'll have Ben's for him, shall I? Here's to you, Ben.

Zahra: I guess, I mean, the thing I think is, if he doesn't make it, God forbid, at least he lived to the max. The Iron Man, we think we were once in the same bar as Banksy.

Jeremy: Wow, yeah, I mean, there's a time for everything, isn't there. You know, there's a time for golf, a time for stew.

Zahra: Yeah.

Jeremy: (Come on, Guru Jez.) I mean, it's the whole circle of life, isn't it? I mean, if you believe in reincarnation, imagine if he went, at the exact same moment that my friend's baby was born. Ben's spirit, his essence, might live on, Bluetoothed into the baby.

Zahra: Yeah, I suppose I could accept that, in a way. It's just him dangling, you know?

Jeremy: We need to get you some answers. Is he going to pull through, you need to know. (I need to know. Right now, I'm a supporting character in a weepy, when I want to be the leading man in a porno.)

Mark: (Yeah, okay, off to the toilet, have a wee and then back in. I could walk quicker, but it's interesting to note that I'm not. I'm walking at what I would describe in court as a normal pace, but which I think is actually slightly slower than normal. There's the toilet. Why didn't I go in? Here I go into here. Okay, this is interesting, where am I going now?) (I think this is okay, this is something somebody might do in my situation. My wife was going into labor, and I decided to leave her ever so briefly, to grab something to eat to fortify me for the events ahead. Oh, right, that sounds wise, that you got a chicken bucket early on. Yes, I know.) Chicken bucket, please.

Fast Food Server: That's gonna take a few minutes, is that okay?

Mark: Yes, I can wait. (Eating from a bucket like a human horse. I feel refreshed and replenished and now back to the hospital. No need to run, and still got some beans and a sweetcorn for Sophie. Probably just what she fancies.) (Is this the worst thing I've ever done? It might be. You can't hide behind that pillar, I'm a sharpshooter. I bet she's okay, all the staff. I'm better off here, I'm safe here, with the gangsters in the killing zone. The abandoned subway station, my safe place, my good place.)

Video Arcade Guy: Looks like you're in trouble there, mate.

Mark: (Oddball alert, do not respond, do not engage. Oh, God, he's broken through my icy force field. Maybe he's having a baby, maybe everyone in here is having babies.)

Jeremy: This is difficult, but if he does make it through, will he still be, operating from below the waistal area?

Doctor: You mean--

Jeremy: Will he still be able to, communicate with his, communication rod, or will he no longer be able to lift the drawbridge, so to speak? I'm thinking about Zara's needs.

Doctor: Look, I can't speculate on that, but I'll be frank with you. We really need to see some movement in the next 24 hours from Ben if a full recovery is going to be on the cards.

Jeremy: Thank you, doctor. (I'm 24 hours from Tulsa.)

Zahra: Thanks, Jez.

Jeremy: (Finally, I'm in pole position. Ben checks out, I check in. I mean, I definitely, definitely hope he doesn't, but if he does, then--)

Zahra: What, Jeremy?

Jeremy: Nothing. (Don't tell her, don't raise her hopes. Could have been anything, phantom toe syndrome, methane build-up, disturbance in the force. Oh, bollocks.) Zara, I think Ben's trying to tell you something, with his foot.

Zahra: Oh, my God look, he's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine, Jez!

Jeremy: That's brilliant, Zara! (Fucking great, the mummy returns. Finally find the woman of my dreams, and her boyfriend reanimates.)

Mark: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

Jeremy: Nice.

Mark: Jez?

Video Arcade Guy: Who's the jerk?

Jeremy: Easy, buddy. I went to see Soph, why are you not in there?

Mark: Yeah, well, Sophie wanted me to grab five and play some Lethal Enforcers.

Jeremy: Really?

Mark: Yeah, she was all, grab five, Mark, you deserve it, I'll be fine.

Jeremy: She didn't mention that. The midwife didn't mention that.

Mark: Yeah, I know, that's because I'm lying.

Jeremy: Look, Mark, I get it, if this was happening to me, I'd be doing what you're doing a hundred times over. But you don't want to look back on today thinking when your baby was being born, you were taking out a ninja.

Video Arcade Guy: Yakuza.

Jeremy: You need to get back in there.

Mark: (He's right, thank God I didn't do bottle of whiskey and random easyJet. I can still pull this round.) Hi, oh, you're not. (That could so easily have been me, a useless gnome, fishing for turds.) Sorry, this should be my birth, where's--

Nurse: Sophie Chapman is in theater three.

Mark: Theater? (Theater, nothing good has ever happened in a theater. Oh, fuck!) Sophie, are you okay?

Sophie: Yeah, I am.

Mark: I'm so sorry I went, I just, I don't know what to say.

Sophie: Did you go, I've been pretty out of it? How long were you gone for?

Mark: Oh, how long, oh ages like, three or four minutes. (This is amazing, I could have finished the level, had an Angry Whopper and upgraded my phone tariff.)

Midwife: Everything slowed down and we wanted to get the baby out, so we decided to come for Cesarean section.

Mark: That's brilliant, I love the salad, now I'll try the birth. The Caesar, Caesarian salad, sorry, I'm gabbling. I'm just happy it's all okay.

Sophie: How's it looking down there?

Mark: Oh--

Midwife: You might not necessarily want to.

Mark: (Holy fuck, living innards, I thought now it'll be hi-tech, chip and pin, not London Dungeon.)

Sophie: Is it okay?

Mark: Yeah.

Sophie: Yeah?

Mark: All good, all great. (The screen's there for a reason. There's a reason they put Guantanamo on Cuba.)

Maternity Theatre Nurse: Now you might feel a bit of a tug, baby's coming out.

Sophie: Okay, oh, it's like someone's doing the washing up. Yeah, I can feel that.

Mark: (Yeah, I imagine so, because a human being is being heaved out of your body. Oh, my goodness.)

Maternity Theatre Nurse: Do you want to cut the cord?

Mark: (No, do you want to do some credit rating or work in a Mexican restaurant? Let's stick to our jobs!) Do people normally--

Maternity Theatre Nurse: Yep.

Sophie: Go on, Mark.

Mark: Oh, okay. (Great, bet I do it wrong and they laugh. Humiliated in front of my son within ten seconds of his birth.) Wow, it's sinewy. (God, I can't get any purchase. Thought it would be like Sarah Ferguson, cutting a ribbon, but it's much more meaty, like sawing a dog's leg in half. Oh, my God, there he is, I've got a baby. Maybe, maybe I might be a good person from now on. That might be a good idea. Yeah, lead a wholesome life and be a decent citizen and make the whole world okay, and yeah, this is a biggy, this is definitely a biggy. Maybe my son can sort climate change. He might figure out cold fusion! Not as one of the main guys, that's unrealistic, but in an administrative capacity.)

Jeremy: Oh, my God, you're a dad.

Mark: I know.

Jeremy: Wow. Listen, this probably doesn't matter right now, but Hans called.

Mark: Oh?

Jeremy: It's all sorted, new boilers up and running and there's minimal water damage. He sent a photo.

Mark: Minimal water damage?

Jeremy: Minimal water damage.

Midwife: Here you go, here's your son.

Mark: (Oh, my God.) My son. Minimal water damage.

# Man Jam

Jeremy: (Wow, me and Hans in band. First jam we demand feelings. The only thing is, why did I say I could play the sax? I can't play the sax. I bet I could manage a couple of tubes, it's basically just a big metal kazoo. How come Denton got the bongos? It's not fair, anyone could bang shit. Give a chimpanzee a double espresso and you've got yourself a drummer. Gotta enter the jam. Well that was a disaster. But, can't back down now.)

Super Hans: Jez, mate, can you stop jamming?

Jeremy: You can't stop someone from jamming. That's against jam law.

Super Hans: Dude, that's not jam. That's just total fucking marmalade.

Jeremy: Okay I'm gonna stop jamming now, but only because my jam is complete and I wish to have a cup of tea. (Yeah, take that. Little do they know, I'm actually probably gonna have a coffee.)

Mark: (Got to have the equipment when the baby comes to stay. The empty buggy, I feel like a maniac whose just dumped his baby at the corner of JD Sports with a rusk and ten euros tapped to it.)

Gerrard: Yeah so I've been hanging out here quit a bit since I got my redundant. It's cool.

Mark: Yeah it is cool. (More like a honey trap for social retards. When the Normalo Nazis firebomb these places, the geek race will be wiped out forever.) So what was the amazing Dobbie news that you had to tell me in person?

Gerrard: Well, the news is, Mark...

Mark: Don't do the X-Factor on me, Gerard.

Gerrard: Dobbie's got a boyfriend.

Mark: Oh, God. Really?

Gerrard: His name is Simon and he's younger, slimmer, better looking, and more fashionable than us.

Mark: (Us? I'm several social ranks your senior. That's the whole basis of our relationship, Gerard.) So, what's he like?

Gerrard: Graphic designer.

Mark: Oh, please. Hello, can I redesign your logo? Yes, that'll be a hundred thousand pounds for a squiggle. (Wish I was a graphic designer.)

Gerrard: And he drives an Audi.

Mark: (But of course.) Full sprung dick technic. (Wish I had an Audi.)

Gerrard: Maybe it's a good thing, a wake up call. Maybe to guys like us, Dobbie was always a pipe dream.

Mark: (Don't pull me into your filthy bath water, I'm a player.)

Gerrard: And it may surprise you to know, but the truth is until I was twenty six, I'd never been with a woman.

Mark: Uh, yes you do surprise me. (You've been with a woman?) Yeah I guess over the years I've had a bit of a tough time with the ladies.

Gerrard: Really?

Mark: I've done some mad shit though. I remember there was this one time in Uni and I was trying it on with this chick and getting nowhere, so I pulled the old palm reading routine, physical contact. And ended up going back to her place. Sweet.

Gerrard: God, really?

Mark: Oh yeah. (Then I talked to her all night about my mother's suspected infidelities until I started to cry.) I've got a million stories like that.

Gerrard: Oh, wow. They've got Stalin.

Mark: What?

Gerrard: They haven't had Uncle Joe in for a while. It's nice detail.

Mark: Yeah, the detail's not bad. (Danger, Mark.)

Gerrard: It's alright Mark, they're not toys, they're just models of historical interest. Wow, look, FDR.

Mark: Right. God, well they're not really my thing.

Gerrard: If you bought FDR, we could get together and model Yalter.

Mark: Yeah, I mean I suppose if you were really keen. (I do want the FDR doll, but is it crossing a line? Oh my god, my heart's racing. It's like when I bought my first twenty-sided die.) I'd like to buy an FDR doll, please.

Games Shop Assistant: Of course.

Mark: It's for my son, he's a big fan of the New Deal, so...

Gerrard: Just grab us a couple of cyber men while you're up in your little store there, will you, pal? They're not for playing with, obviously. Just gonna keep them in mint condition in their boxes.

Games Shop Assistant: Yeah, of course you are, mate.

Ben: We wanted to say thank you, Jez, for being there for Zara while I was unconscious.

Jeremy: Oh, no worries. (How can I steal your girlfriend? How can I steal your girlfriend?)

Ben: With my pace of life, sometimes you need to pull a coma just to chow down on some serious chilling.

Jeremy: Word. (I liked you a lot more when you were unconscious, Ben. That was a great look for you.)

Zahra: We want to show you our gratitude, Jez.

Ben: We want to make you an offer.

Jeremy: (Threesome, probably. God, it's like being offered a tiramisu and a dead kitten on the same plate.)

Ben: Did Zara tell you about my website? It's a music portal, five figure hit rate. Hey, I must be doing something right.

Jeremy: (Massive twat.) Yeah, well, I've always believed the internet is actually gonna be pretty big.

Ben: I could use someone to do website management.

Jeremy: (I don't want a job.)

Zahra: I don't work there, but I'm around all the time, it's like a little family.

Jeremy: I would like a job.

Ben: You'll be focused on keeping the portal ticking over, but you'll get a little part for developing new artists.

Jeremy: I'd be head of the label?

Ben: Yeah, I guess Jez, you'll be, uh, head of the label.

Jeremy: (This is brilliant! I could do the job, have an affair, juggle them both til it all blows up in my stupid face.) (Yes Shakira, I'm Jeremy and you're actually very much too poppy for my taste. But it you suck this, I might put you out on my label.)

Gerrard: Put FDR next to Stalin like that, and I can put Cyber Man here.

Mark: What's that?

Gerrard: That's just Cyber Man attacking Roosevelt.

Mark: I feel uneasy about the noises, Gerard. Anyway, why does Cyber Man attack Roosevelt?

Gerrard: He's a Cyber Man, Mark. He's devoid of all human emotion, concerned only with the preservation of his own race. Of course he'd attack Roosevelt.

Mark: Oh, hi Jez.

Jeremy: Sorry to interrupt you playing, boys.

Mark: We're not, were just rearranging our models with some noises. Anyway, what are you doing back from your new job so early? Fired already?

Jeremy: I'm back so early because I have the coolest job in the world and Ben is the coolest boss in the world. I asked him when I should come in tomorrow, and he said, "whenever you can make it". His motto is: The work never starts.

Mark: That's his motto? What's his annual turnover?

Jeremy: Who gives a shit? We don't make money, money makes us.

Mark: What does that even mean?

Jeremy: It means I'm gonna light up a fatty and crack open my brand new X-box. Good luck with the regression sesh.

Mark: Look, I'm sorry if in an infantalized world I've somehow ended up with a non-cool toy, but why exactly is arranging a model of the greatest liberal hero of the twentieth century somehow less cool than pretending on a computer that you're a Russian pimp stealing imaginary cars.

Jeremy: I don't know, dude. I don't make the rules. Enjoy playing soldiers and wanking over Dobbie on Facebook.

Mark: For god sake, Jeremy, that's disgusting.

Gerrard: Did you ever actually, uh...

Mark: Well, you know, on occasion.

Gerrard: Corfu '06? Its cool, man. You know, I've never actually gone that far myself. But, everything's cool in Dobby club.

Mark: (Ah, we have a Dobby club. Or the Dobby ring. Can two people be a ring?)

Super Hans: I am a local apprentice. I am the last remaining contestant on the apprentice. I am the home trained dentist. Aya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

Gerrard: Should we go and join the happy couple?

Mark: Why ever not? (Relationship commandos reeking havoc behind enemy lines.)

Dobby: Hi guys! Thanks for tipping us off about tonight. Mental.

Mark: Our pleasure.

Simon: Yeah, the bands were incredible.

Gerrard: Yes, we saw you dancing.

Dobby: Weren't they amazing?

Simon: Sorry, Dobbs, did you really... I thought we were dancing sarcastically.

Dobby: Oh no, that was my real dancing. Did you not like them?

Simon: That was your actual dancing?

Gerrard: Yes, its funny isn't it, when one half of a couple likes something but the other just doesn't get it?

Dobby: Well, opposites attract.

Mark: (The cracks are starting to show. The cracks are starting to show!)

Jeremy: So listen, you know since you, uh, invited me out of the band, I've got this job.

Super Hans: Yeah, we heard. That's uh, that's great you could make it down. Bit of a weird one, we had to uh, invite you out of the band.

Jeremy: Yeah, well X is X. (Is that a thing?) Obviously I've got this uh, development pot.

Super Hans: So, what, you might sign us? Like we even care.

Jeremy: Look, you're on my radar. (I'm the emperor now.) But um, the look's not really working for me.

Super Hans: What uh, what kind of look do you think we should go for?

Jeremy: I was thinking... (What was I thinking?) Zoot suites.

Super Hans: Zoot suites?

Jeremy: Definitely zoot suites, and um, also the name. I mean, "Man Feelings"?

Super Hans: That's our USP, 'cause we're all men, and we have feelings. We're a group of men with feelings who play in a band. We're like The Chili Peppers. Can't think of another band full of dudes right now, but uh there are loads.

Jeremy: Hm, I was thinking something more distinctive.

Super Hans: Like what?

Jeremy: Like "Danny Dires Chocolate Homunculus".

Super Hans: Danny Dires Chocolate Homunculus. Um, is it a deal breaker?

Jeremy: It could be a deal breaker. It certainly a game changer. (I sound so important.) Suit yourselves, boys. I've got other fish to fry, in my...frying pan. (Sweet exit line. Now, to find the exit. I can't really see a thing with these on. Can I turn that into a little dance? Nope, play it cool.)

Super Hans: Jez, look, um, if you sign us, I'll persuade them about the suites and go with the name, deal?

Jeremy: Yeah, there is one other thing. Your bongo guy. He sucks ass. You need a shit hop bongista and I think I know where to find one. You get me?

Mark: Nice work bringing up renewable energy, Gerard. Looks like they're having a full and frank discussion.

Gerrard: Simple bit of research. Someone's winning out of climate change. But listen, Mark, we ought to decide, you know if it breaks down, which of the Dobbie club gets first dibs on Dobbs?

Mark: Um, right yeah, good point. (This is it, this is my Yalta. Dobbie's Poland, I'm wiley Stalin. Out foxing sickly FDR.)

Gerrard: What say you to a coin toss?

Mark: Why not? (Except, is FDR dead by Yalta? Gerard's Truman with the A bomb. Relax Mark, not actually at Yalta.)

Gerrard: Heads or tails?

Mark: Heads, obviously. (If I win, I win. If I lose, I'll simply ignore it. Stalin's prerogative.)

Gerrard: Uh, heads. You win, Mark.

Mark: Too bad. Well, to this unshakable pact of brothers do we swear enduring honor. Yes? (Dobby, where in cyberspace are you? No updates for 72 hours. Is this a bit like stalking? Stalking's a very loaded term. I prefer to think of it as an extreme liking.)

Jeremy: Hiya

Mark: Jez? It's 12:00 on a Saturday, and you're up? You've been out? Are you tripping?

Jeremy: Phone rang at 7:00. He wanted me to go into the office.

Mark: But I thought work never starts?

Jeremy: Yeah well, apparently work never starts, but work never stops.

Mark: Never stops?

Jeremy: He's got me by the Blackberries. Turning it off is a sackable offense. If I go to a funeral, I can switch it to vibrate.

Mark: Well that's something.

Jeremy: Plus, it turns out the website, you know it's really mainly about the merch.

Mark: Merch?

Jeremy: Merchandise. Ben says I'm all about the merch. Cut me and I bleed merch. I can't believe I had him at my mercy in the hospital and I let him go. If I'd known he was such as ass I'd have at least given his tube a little waggle.

Mark: Yeah, murdering your enemies is quite a simple solution. Which I guess is why in ethics and law it's so frowned upon.

Jeremy: He wasn't even there. It was just me and the servers. After a while, I started to pretend I was a robot. And, then, I sort of couldn't remember if I was a robot or not, so I had to get out of there. Anyway, I nicked you some manilla envelopes. 'Cause I know you like to stockpile them. Ooh, Mark is that okay? By the shredder? Can babies go by shredders?

Mark: Yes, of course. Safest place for it. Stable temperature, plus if there was an earth tremor, Which, obviously, there isn't going to be, he's got added protection. I've got him for the day. It's amazing, the bond. Earlier, I was changing him and he pissed all over me. No ill feeling, nothing.

Jeremy: Wow, cause' you, you're pretty uptight. I mean, you hate people pissing on you.

Mark: Exactly, plus if you went for him now, I'd stab you.

Jeremy: Great, that's nice.

Mark: Stab you in the eyes.

Jeremy: Yeah alright, I get the picture.

Mark: Hey watch this. Time me. Imagine the cushion is a baby. You see, if there was a bus coming, I could strip and fold this beauty in under 5 seconds.

Jeremy: Great. Tea? (Of course he's happier with the kid. I bet he wishes the baby was a mortar round.) (Oh, no milk. Not black tea, I'm not some kind of monster. Hello, the human cow. Why not? Luxury milk, lady milk. Because you deserve it.)

Mark: Jeremy! Come! Come and look at this. You have to come and look at this now!

Jeremy: If it's another alleged error on Nikita Khrushchev's Wikipedia page, then I can't say I'm getting very worked up about it.

Mark: This was taken less than half an hour ago.

Jeremy: So?

Mark: Dobbie's updated, she's not in a relationship but she is at her bloody sister's birthday dew with Gerard!

Jeremy: Right.

Mark: He's done the dirty on me, Jez. He's making a mockery of our granita moment. He's blaring me.

Jeremy: You're no brown, Mark. Your hands are made of flesh and blood.

Mark: Golden Man didn't actually have a metal fist. It was just...

Jeremy: No? I thought there was something wrong with his arm or his ear, wasn't there?

Mark: Hold on, I didn't think we had any milk.

Jeremy: Uh, no we do.

Mark: No, we definitely don't because I couldn't have any Saltaler Bran this morning. There's no milk in the fridge. Except...Oh!

Jeremy: Mark, relax.

Mark: This is Sophie's milk, isn't it?

Jeremy: Think of it as lady milk. From the human cow.

Mark: Jeremy this, it's one step away from cannibalism!

Jeremy: Oh right so it's weird to drink milk from someone you know but, to drink milk from another species, some cow that you've never met, that's fine is it?

Mark: Yes, it bloody well is.

Jeremy: Well, suit yourself. Mmmmm, luxury milk. Sweet. Just texted Ben. Said I had to go to a funeral. Plus, I've got the squids and you're locked in the bathroom having a breakdown. I threw a lot of shit at the wall, we'll see what sticks.

Mark: Look at him, he's the worst kind of snake in the grass.

Jeremy: What a shit.

Mark: I mean, obviously I'd have betrayed him like that, but...

Jeremy: Yeah but he didn't know that.

Mark: Yeah, exactly Jez, thank you. He, oh my god that's my idea! He's using my idea!

Jeremy: You taught him the palm, but I taught you the palm!

Mark: He's juicing my balls! He's trying to screw her with my cock.

Jeremy: Shit, Ben. Ben Ten! The Bento box. Yes, I am still at the funeral.

Mark: (Great, I've got a front row seat in the theater of cruelty. Ugh, just watching them is making these normally delicious butterscotch treats turn to ash in my mouth.)

Jeremy: That's the whole story.

Mark: I'm going in. Tony B. Liar can disregard the U.N. but he can't disregard the Dobby Club.

Jeremy: Baby? Uh, yeah, that's just the baby obviously at the funeral with me. Don't worry little one, she's in Heaven. Your mommy's in Heaven now. (The baby doesn't have a clue what I'm one about, it's fine.)

Gerrard: Mark, what are you doing here?

Mark: I could ask you the very same question. Judas.

Gerrard: Well, Dobby didn't have anyone to come to the party with, so I volunteered.

Mark: How incredibly thoughtful, Brutus.

Gerrard: Yes, well...

Mark: You knew very well that we had a deal. (Can't think of another one.) Double Judas.

Gerrard: Look, nothing's going on, alright? We're just having a drink.

Mark: I think you're doing a little more than that. No doubt once you finish these, and she sufficiently high on enumbers, you're trying to play her with another pork product whose name I don't think needs to be said out loud.

Gerrard: I'm sorry, Mark, okay? I saw a window of opportunity and I went for it. You would have done the same.

Mark: Unlike you, Gerard, I'm a man of my word. The Dobby Club is officially dissolved.

Gerrard: What about the achymous victory?

Mark: I shall be completing the achymous victory without your assistance.

Gerrard: You can't handle the rigging on your own.

Mark: You had your chance to help me with that rigging. And you blew it.

Jeremy: Yeah, yeah I'm hoping people might affectionately call them the Homunculi. I'm gonna sign them tomorrow night after the gig. No, no need for you to come, dude. No, just check out the webpage. But ignore all the shitty comments. They're all made by the same 30-40 people so they don't really count.

Dobby: Mark? What the fuck?

Mark: Hello.

Dobby: Where's Gerard?

Mark: Gerard had to go. He was taken ill.

Dobby: What, really? Is it serious?

Mark: A bit, but also you needn't give it a second thought. The squirts. (No further details required.) May I?

Dobby: So, you just happened to be in Epson?

Mark: Yeah but I was in the car, I'm on standby.

Dobby: Standby?

Mark: As Gerard's replacement. Its cool, we look out for one another. Like me and Jess, he's right over there, so if god forbids something should happen, he'll be there to replace me.

Dobby: I have to say, I'm mildly freaking my noggin right now.

Mark: Look, Dobby the truth is, me and Gerard, we have a a sort of a club about you.

Dobby: A club?

Mark: It's not a real club, there's no clubhouse and there's only two of us. It's more of a shared passion, if you will. It's quite sophisticated like the Sunday Times wine club. But it's ironic too, so... (Hmm, not nailing this.)

Dobby: So Gerard's not ill then.

Mark: No more than usual, he agreed to step aside. Abort your date and let me have a pop.

Dobby: A pop?

Mark: Not a pop, a go, a turn. (Really not nailing this at all.) Excuse me. Hello, how are you? Hungry? Or another one of your dirty protests? Oh, no you're good, just a blanket.

Dobby: Oh...

Mark: (Oh okay, of course.) If you like you can smell my baby.

Dobby: Yeah?

Mark: That new baby smell, it's amazing it's like caramel and roses. (Total emperor's new clothes. They smell of baby soap and very faintly of urine.)

Dobby: Mmmmm.

Mark: (Nice. The ultimate aphrodisiac, my son's like a huge oyster.) Look, the truth is, I came out here because I was insane with jealousy and if that's freaky than ill just go. But, the thing about driving for miles to spy on someone is that, if nothing else, it does sort of prove that you have quite strong feelings.

Dobby: Yeah? Me and Carrie once hitched a Carlyle just because they have this wicked big half boats.

Mark: Look, if there's nothing happening with you and Gerard, does that actually mean that there's a position vacant? As your boyfriend?

Dobby: What an incredibly off-putting way of putting it. If I say yes, will you stop saying things which are turning my stomach?

Mark: (Oh my god, I've won. I'm resigning from the FDR Cyber man conflict.)

Jeremy: And you're sure these are zoot suits?

Super Hans: Yeah, these are zoot suits.

Jeremy: Yeah, I mean, I love them, obviously. It's just um, I thought there'd be more...

Super Hans: We spent all yesterday going around 15 village clothing outfitters spending 530 quid on zoot suits. These are definitely fucking zoot suits.

Jeremy: Yeah, great, I love them. So I got the uh, contract. You still wanna do the punk thing?

Super Hans: I only sign in blood.

Zahra: Hey Jez!

Jeremy: Zara! You came...in time to see me play.

Zahra: You're playing?

Zahra: Sure I told you I was in a band.

Zahra: Yeah but you told me you're a poet and then you couldn't find your exercise books so... Wow, Jez, I love musicians.

Jeremy: Well I'm a musician, so I guess you must love me! (Is that a joke? Or just a genuine wish with me laughing at the end?)

Ben: Hey, Jez.

Jeremy: Great, Mr. Ben. The Homunculi welcome you.

Ben: We need to talk business, babe. Get yourself a drink, mine's a large one as you fucking know.

Jeremy: So uh, I just wanted to flag out with you about the band. I'm going to taking on a much more hands on role than your traditional exec. In fact,

Ben: Forget the band, I'm not signing these twats.

Jeremy: What?

Ben: I listened to the link, they're shit. And branding, do you even know what a homunculus is?

Jeremy: Is it a chick born with a dick?

Ben: Its one of those tiny humans mad scientists keep in jars. Who wants that on a baseball cap?

Jeremy: Uh, goths?

Ben: Lose the arseholes.

Jeremy: (Oh fucking great, I've got to fire myself, I wonder how ill take it. Very badly I should imagine.)

Super Hans: Arghhh

Jeremy: Okay guys, so heres the thing.

Super Hans: Here, I'm uh, losing quite a bit here, so if we could just sign? I'm breaking out the allesterplast.

Jeremy: Yeah, look, I've been thinking with my thinking cap, and basically yeah, were a great band and obviously I could sign us, of course I could. Um, I could sign us a thousand times over, but are we hungry enough? I mean sure, were hungry, but are we ravenous? Because

Ben: Did you fire them yet?

Jeremy: Firing them now, Ben.

Super Hans: You what? Bollucks, you don't fire us. We fire you. You're fired!

Jeremy: No, you're fired. I mean all of us were fired. But were all in this together against the fucking suits. Who are me, so, fuck me! Why don't we show me what I'm missing and do the best gig of our lives. Yeah!

Mark: (Okay, wow. This is it. The ultimate. I'm in a relationship with someone I really like. Something's obviously gonna have to go wrong. I wonder what it's gonna be. Its almost definitely gonna be something I do. I need to watch myself like a hawk.)

Super Hans: Hello, broccoli. Um, I've an announcement to make. Danny Dires Chocolate Homunculus is dead. But, Man Feelings are back. You are witnesses of the rebirth of Man Feelings.

Mark: (Is she thinking about her ex? Bet she bloody is. When she goes quiet, is she always thinking about him?) You having a look, there?

Dobby: Huh? Yeah, just looking.

Mark: (It's impossible to know what's going on in her head. And if I ask her, she doesn't necessarily have to tell the truth.) So, what are you thinking, Dobbs?

Dobby: Oh just, I mean, I wonder how long the cider craze is going to last.

Mark: Right. Yeah, me too. (Oh, sure. Why is she a separate entity? There should be a viewing platform to see into her brain. If only I could get her brain a jar, or hook her up to electrodes. I need thorough imaging of her brain cortex and a lab to analyze it afterwards. Then, I could finally relax.)

Jeremy: (Right, suited and booted, yeah I'm just another band member running late because there was one last line of coke that needed snorting. Just uh, slide this up on here. Yeah, that right honey. One foot in the band. I'm rejoining you by the power of standing right by you.)

Super Hans: Sorry about this everyone, um, just wanna clear something up. This is the band area, we are the band. This imaginary line at the edge of the stage is where the band ends. This man is not in the band, he is merely dressed like the band.

Dobby: I hope me and you being an item doesn't ruin my friendship with Gerard.

Mark: Me too, that, that would be terrible. (Ugh, the ghost at the feast. I'm going to kill you, Gerard. Kill you till you're dead.) Although there is something I should probably tell you.

Dobby: What?

Mark: I don't really want to say...

Dobby: Go on, Mark.

Mark: Well, You know those Corfu pictures you've got on your profile? I think maybe you should take those down.

Dobby: Corfu '06? Why?

Mark: Well Gerard admitted that sometimes he looks at them and does, uh...

Dobby: Ugh!

Mark: I know. (Never pick a fight with Stalin, Gerrard. Uncle Joe don't play by your rules.)
